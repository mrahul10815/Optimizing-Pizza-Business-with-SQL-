# Optimizing-Pizza-Business-with-SQL-Order-Analysis-and-Revenue-Insights
I recently completed a project using MySQL to analyze a pizza restaurant's sales data. Here's a glimpse of what I achieved:

Basic Analysis:

--Total Orders: I retrieved the total number of orders placed, giving a high-level view of customer activity.
--Pizza Revenue: I calculated the total revenue generated specifically from pizza sales.
--Pizza Category Distribution: I explored the distribution of pizzas across different categories, revealing customer preferences.
--Top Priced & Sized Pizzas: I identified the most expensive pizza on the menu and the most commonly ordered size.
--Top 5 Pizzas: I revealed the top 5 most popular pizzas in terms of quantity ordered.

Going Further (Intermediate & Advanced):

--Deeper Dives: I delved deeper to analyze total quantities per pizza category, order frequency by hour, average daily orders, and the top 3 pizzas based on revenue contribution.
--Revenue Insights: I examined the contribution of each pizza to the overall revenue, providing valuable insights into profitability.
--Time-Based Analysis: I explored the cumulative revenue generated over time, uncovering sales trends.
--Category-Specific Performance: I identified the top 3 highest-revenue pizzas within each category, allowing for targeted marketing strategies.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in writing SQL queries to extract valuable insights from data. It highlights my ability to analyze sales data, identify trends, and generate reports that can inform business decisions.
